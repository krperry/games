Let’s first understand the game’s rules before writing the blackjack game.

In blackjack, each player and dealer receives two cards.  The player
can then choose to “play” (request another card) or “stop” (keep on
hold until a new request is made). The goal in this game is to keep
the sum of all card points equal to 21 without exceeding it. Face
cards (i.e. Jack, Queen, and King) are worth 10 points, and Aces can
be worth 11 points. If a player has more than 21 points then the
player automatically loses the game.

When playing at a Casino the dealer will hit if he has less than 17
and stay if he has 17 or more. This doesn't matter as much when
playing just one on one but it does when playing multiple players.  It
gives the House a better chance of coming out on top.  We will code our dealer to do this.

Now that we have a basic
understanding of the rules of the game, let’s start building the game
using Python. We will use the following steps to build the game:

1) Set up the deck of cards 
2) Shuffle the deck 
3) Deal the initial cards 
4) Allow the player to hit or stand 
5) Deal the dealer’s cards 
    A) Test card score dealer has if lower than 17 hit
    B) If higher than or equal to 17 stay    
6) Determine the winner
